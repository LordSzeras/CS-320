Software Testing and Automation

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  For the work that we did, unit tests.  Having created the unit tests for each function and each requirement will help to ensure that everything is working as intended.  The tests we created were  able to help pinpoint any defects in our code in a specific manner.  We had a unit test for each limit imposed by the functional requirements.  So when one test failed, we knew exactly what was failing and which part.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I made sure to look at the functional requirements.  After looking at the requirements, I started by figuring out which tests I needed to make and creating a stand in for them.  This way, I knew that I had all the right tests to ensure I met all of the requirements.  Then I went and created the code followed by creating the test code.  Then it was a simple matter of make code, run tests, repeat.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  I start by looking at what is being asked.  After  figuring out the functional requirements, I can start designing the classes.  Once I have the basics, like the class attributes and the functions that they need to perform, I can start looking at limitations, such as a name that can't be more than 10 characters long.  Now I start going back and adding in code to ensure that the limit can't be ignored.  Then, I start building the meat of the tests and running them.  As I add more code, I rerun the tests.  Rinse, lather, repeat...
